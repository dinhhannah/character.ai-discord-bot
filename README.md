# Make your own character.ai Discord bot

Bring your favorite characters from character.ai to Discord!

This code was made using unofficial character.ai API made by kramcat
* Character.ai --> https://beta.character.ai/
* API for c.ai --> https://github.com/kramcat/CharacterAI

***Warning***: This code cannot run on Jupyter Notebook due to instance creation issues. The code must be run locally instead. 

## How to talk to your Discord bot

The format to prompt your bot is as follows: 

```
[text input] @[Discord Bot Name]
```

For example, *Hello @[Discord Bot Name]* is one way of summoning your bot!

## To Do

* Filter out the "@[Discord Bot Name]" part and put text input into the API
* Make the bot able to recognize different people talking in the conversation
* Shorten bot responses
